The authors describe how RBMs can learn an unknown probability distribution from a set of data pulled from that distribution (this was discussed in Research Article 1 as well). The goal in this training of RBMs is to find the optimal parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the energy functional. Traditionally, complex wave functions in many body complex quantum problems have been solved with tensor networks (TNs) but these can’t really work to solve systems that are subject to volume law entanglement vice area law. Entanglement here means particles in a system do not act independently; they’re movements are correlated. So area law entanglement means entropy of the system scales with area (etc. for volume). I was able to read more about area law on page 2 here (Eisert, Cramer, and Plenio 2008)"

Wave functions are the answer to this and there are many many possible wave functions depending on the quantum state. The ability of the RBM to handle volume law entanglement problems makes them useful in quantum physics."

    "text": "Goal of Paper:\nThe goal of the paper was to share their model (they refer to as R-E-BLS) and it’s superiority in predictive analysis tasks. The authors first explain the drawbacks of deep neural networks, explaining that building them deeply seriously increases computation time. Random vector function linked neural networks–and their successor, broad learning systems(BLS)–help by building the network wider instead of deeper. The Echo State Netowrk (ESN) contains a sparse reservoir (this contrasts a dense reservoir ex: fully connected network where every neuron in the reservoir is connected to every other neuron by having non zero weights). The authors introduce Broad Echo State Networks (BESNs) which combines broad learning system and echo state networks. Finally, they extend the thought further for time series forecasting problems by suggesting use of RBM in mapping layer, ESN in enhancement layer (R-E-BLS). They show the model and run experiments on it on 3 separate datasets. They explain issues with current time series forecasting like Moving Average (MA) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) where there is high dependence on linearity. They describe how the data input into the RBM mapping layer where RBM generates mapping nodes. The number of feature mapping nodes can be adjusted by adjusting network parameters of the RBM (connection weights between visible and hidden units, bias of visible unit, bias of hidden unit). Final output combines mapping and enhancement layers. The authors then discuss a huge advantage of R-E-BLS is the ability to incrementally learn (train only feature nodes or input data that needs to be added to the model without rebuilding the entire network (like standard deep learning networks))."

The authors discuss the difficulty in network anomaly detection where anomaly is “unusual” meaning non-normal traffic patterns that could be indicative of an attack. They describe the difficulty of obtaining datasets for supervised classification as many clients are reluctant to divulge information that could expose the internal structure of their networks and how this has basically led to slow progress in the industry of predicting anomalous network activity in general. The authors are testing whether or not there’s enough similarity in normal network behaviors for a model to learn all nuisances of normal traffic when faced with unseen anomalous network traffic. This led them to to the DRBM because of it’s classification ability with all the power of a generative model."

However, this can cause a lot of misclassification where normal events are incorrectly classified as anomalous. Their experiment involves two datasets: a real network traffic dataset with two hosts (one with normal traffic and one with traffic infected by a bot) and the KDD ’99 training dataset which was tested against the real data. They used 28 features related to network traffic in the training and used accuracy, speed, comprehensibility, and time to learn as evaluation parameters. The free energy patterns seen in the diagrams of normal and anomalous activity show the RBM was able to distinguish between the two."

The authors first discuss all the various applications of GAN to MRI imaging studies and the use of RBMs with deep learning to classify brain diseases. The diseases of the brain studied here are: brain atrophy, ischemia, and white matter density with a control group of a normal brain. The first step is data augmentation and resizing of the brain MR images, then normalization. Then, the RBM extracts features of only the brain region and feeds this input to the GAN generator and the pre-processed real image data are fed to the GAN discriminator where the generator tries to generate fake data similar to the real data it’s learned and the discriminator chooses what data is real and fake (these two parts of the GAN are trained simultaneously). After training with GAN, several classifiers were tested (tree, linear discriminant, naiive bayes, SVM, KNN, ensemble, neural network and K-mean)."

    "text": "Goal of Paper:\nEven with GPU, RBMs are still pretty slow during calculation of vector dot products which is done to compute the activation probability. Lean Contrastive Divergence (LCD) adds two optimization techniques which speed up the progress significantly, as discussed in results. The two optimization techniques are as follows. 1. Bounds-based filtering: uses lower and upper bounds of P(hj = 1, given v) to select a range of dot products to perform, avoiding any unnecessary dot products. The conservative bounds are found with triangle inequality. 2. Delta product: uses only the necessary operations in calculating dot products. The authors discuss how during RBM training, the network updates states/neurons across the Gibbs sampling steps/epochs. Toward the beginning, some neurons switch states (flip between 0 and 1) but later in training, less units flip states. They took advantage of the fact that many don’t flip states by realizing the non-flipped units are repeating computations unnecessarily. So, they only re-calculate the changed parts of the dot product. In Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM, visible units are real values while hidden units are binary. The authors used bounds based filtered on the hidden units and delta product to sample visible units."

They also solved an issue where although GPUs are good at handling regular calculations, LCD doesn’t work great with GPU. Because of this, the authors implemented two things. 1) Aggregated warp filterings. The RBM has to keep track of which nodes flipped states during iterations. Each thread checks if a difference was detected (neuron flipped states between iterations). Warps are groups of threads (ex: NVIDIA GPU a warp is 32 threads). Aggregated warp filterings means only the warp leader (first active thread in the warp) chooses where the writing is done in the array. Then the other threads write their differences in the locations the warp leader chose. This is all done in parallel, avoiding thread conflicts. ## Storing extra copies of W transpose. GPUs are bandwidth sensitive and in RBMs, the W matrix is used in sample the visible layer and it’s transpose is used in sampling the hidden layer so the authors store a copy of W transpose in it’s own array so it doesn’t need to be recomputed."

    "text": "Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are a type of neural network that has been around since the 1980s. As a reminder to the reader, machine learning is generally divided into 3 categories: supervised learning (examples: classification tasks, regression), unsupervised learning (examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction, generative modeling), and reinforcement learning (examples: gaming/robotics). RBMs are primarily used for unsupervised learning tasks like dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, which help prepare datasets for machine learning models that may later be trained using supervised learning. They also have other applications which will be discussed further later.\nLike Hopfield networks, Boltzmann machines are undirected graphical models, but they are different in that they are stochastic and can have hidden units. Both models are energy-based, meaning they learn by minimizing an energy function for each model (Smolensky et al. 1986). Boltzmann machines use a sigmoid activation function, which allows for the model to be probabilistic.\nIn the “Restricted” Boltzmann Machine, there are no interactions between neurons in the visible layer or between neurons in the hidden layer, creating a bipartite graph of neurons. Below is a diagram taken from Goodfellow, et al. (Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville 2016) (p. 577) for visualization of the connections.\n \nGoodfellow, et al. discuss the expense in drawing samples for most undirected graphical models; however, the RBM allows for block Gibbs sampling (p. 578) where the network alternates between sampling all hidden units simultaneously (etc. for visible).

E. Hinton 2002) where the weights are updated to minimize the difference between samples from the data and samples from the model.

In a real-life dataset where one host had normal traffic and one was infected by a bot, discriminative RBM (DRBM) was able to successfully distinguish the normal from anomalous traffic.

    "text": "Methods\nBelow is the energy function of the RBM.\n\\[\nE(v,h) = - \\sum_{i} a_i v_i - \\sum_{j} b_j h_j - \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} v_i w_{i,j} h_j\n\\tag{1}\\] where vi and hj represent visible and hidden units; ai and bj are the bias terms of the visible and hidden units; and each w{i,j} (weight) element represents the interaction between the visible and hidden units. (Fischer and Igel 2012)\nIt is well known neural networks are prone to overfitting and often techniques such as early stopping are employed to prevent it. Some methods to prevent overfitting in RBMs are weight decay (L2 regularization), dropout, dropconnect, and weight uncertainty (Zhang et al. 2018). Dropout is a fairly well known concept in deep learning. For example, a dropout value of 0.3 added to a layer means 30% of neurons are dropped during training. This prevents the network from learning certain features too well. L2 regularization is also a commonly employed technique in deep learning. It assigns a penalty to large weights to allow for more generalization. Dropconnect is a method where a subset of weights within the network are randomly set to zero during training. Weight uncertainty is where each weight in the network has it’s own probability distribution vice a fixed value. This addition allows the network to learn more useful features.\nIf the learning rate is too high, training of the model may not converge. If it is too low, training may take a long time. To fully maximize the training of the model it is helpful to reduce the learning rate over time. This is known as learning rate decay. (G. Hinton 2010)\n\nLogistic Regression\nOne technique we explore is standardizing Fashion MNIST features/pixels, then training a RBM (unsupervised learning) to extract hidden features from the visible layer and then feed these features into the Logistic Regression Model (vice feeding the raw pixels). The hidden features from the RBM are standardized again before being used as input features for the logistic regression classifier. Then we use the trained logistic regression model to predict labels for test data, evaluating how well the RBM-derived features perform in a supervised classification task. It is helpful to remind the reader about the methodology behind Logistic Regression.\n\\[\nP(Y = k | X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_{0k} + \\beta_k^T X}}{\\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\\beta_{0l} + \\beta_l^T X}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nMathematically, the concept behind binary logistic regression is the logit (the natural logarithm of an odds ratio)(Peng, Lee, and Ingersoll 2002). However, since we have 10 labels, our classification task falls into “Multinomial Logistic Regression.”\n\n\nBelow is our Process for creating the RBM:\nStep 1: We first initialize the RBM with random weights and biases and set visible units to 784 and hidden units to 256. We also set the number of contrastive divergence steps (k) to 1.  Step 2: Sample hidden units from visible. The math behind computing the hidden unit activations from the given input can be seen in Equation 3 (Fischer and Igel 2012) where the probability is used to sample from the Bernoulli distribution.  \\[\np(H_i = 1 | \\mathbf{v}) = \\sigma \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{m} w_{ij} v_j + c_i \\right)\n\\tag{3}\\] Step 3: Sample visible units from hidden. The math behind computing visible unit activations from the hidden layer can be seen in Equation 4 (Fischer and Igel 2012) Visible states are sampled using the Bernoulli distribution. This way we can see how well the RBM learned from the inputs.  \\[\np(V_j = 1 | \\mathbf{h}) = \\sigma \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{ij} h_i + b_j \\right)\n\\tag{4}\\]\nStep 4: K=1 steps of Contrastive Divergence (Feed Forward, Feed Backward) which executes steps 2 and 3. Contrastive Divergence updates the RBM’s weights by minimizing the difference between the original input and the reconstructed input created by the RBM.  Step 5: Free energy is computed. The free energy F is given by the logarithm of the partition function Z (Oh, Baggag, and Nha 2020) where the partition function is  \\[\nZ(\\theta) \\equiv \\sum_{v,h} e^{-E(v,h; \\theta)}\n\\tag{5}\\] and the free energy function is  \\[\nF(\\theta) = -\\ln Z(\\theta)\n\\tag{6}\\] where lower free energy means the RBM learned the visible state well.\nStep 6: Train the RBM. Model weights updated via gradient descent. Step 7: Feature extraction for classification with LR. The hidden layer activations of the RBM are used as features for LR.\n\n\nHyperparameter Tuning\nWe use the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator algorithm from Optuna (Akiba et al. 2019) to tune the hyperparameters of the RBM and the classifier models, and we use MLFlow (Zaharia et al. 2018) to record and visualize the results of the hyperparameter tuning process. The hyperparameters we tune include the learning rate, batch size, number of hidden units, and number of epochs."
